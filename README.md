# draft-webpage-design

Ticket -N- Go is a mock app that allows users to sign up and buy or sell even tickets. As a group we split up tasks and teamed up to build a page using various technologies to fetch location, get user authentication, and use a data-base for ticket information.

- Google maps API
- Firebase
- Mobile authentication
- JavaScript to create a live-updated auction house
